Th 02/01/2018 12:29:04.85 | Started website development, finally found my motivation to start my online portfolio. Got some inspiration from my mentor and some encouragement from my bosses.

Mon 02/05/2018 12:29:04.85 | Installed some Jquery libraries today and further exploration on how Git works. Also learned some nifty stuff for notepad++, adding timestamps. Started initial design, made banner image on photoshop, edited theme fonts and updated the child theme to contain the Jquery libraries. (general thoughts) 

About me: As the latin saying goes In vino veritas In wine, truth no this is not a winery website lol
Don't let the phrase Invinoveritas fool you, this is not a ecommerce website where I sell wines and liquors. I'am Vino Baquiran and this is my website where I will be sharing my portfolio, blog, ideas and truth.

Do i need to install a plugin to handle structure editing just like aceide? 

Still havent figured out how to make my smart3d element responsive on portrait devices. opened up some media query tips pertaining to bootstrap tweaking and media queries for landscape and portrait. Will have to experiment to find what will work.

Worked on middle section of my website, got hover.css working. Not happy with the current barrel icon, might change it. Also not happy with header section. Designing is really hard. :(
